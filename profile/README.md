## Hedia Diabetes Assistant (HDA)

A class IIb medical device designed to improve the management of insulin-requiring diabetes.

Developed in close collaboration with patients, nurses, and other key stakeholders, our goal is to help patients achieve better health outcomes, including greater stability of blood glucose levels, by providing tools to manage diabetes more effectively. HDA is currently on the market in 11 countries.

As a new user in the UK or Germany, you can get an access code to HDA from the diabetes clinics or health insurance companies we collaborate with.
